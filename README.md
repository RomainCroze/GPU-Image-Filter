-----

The aim of the project was to learn the basics of the shaders and to compare GPU and CPU speed for several image filters (17). Here is an extract of my contribution for this project realized at Telecom ParisTech.

### How to use:
-----

Compile the program with a compiler of your choice (tested with GCC). The executable only takes one argument: the image path. Then you can right click on the image to apply the filter.
